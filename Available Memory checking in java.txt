Code:
public class RealtimeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        while (true) {
            System.out.println("Available memory: " + Runtime.getRuntime().freeMemory() + " bytes");
            try { Thread.sleep(1000); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
        }
    }
}

Explanation:

1.	public class RealtimeExample { ... }: We define a RealtimeExample class with a main method.

2.	while (true) { ... }: This is an infinite loop that will run indefinitely.

3.	System.out.println("Available memory: " + Runtime.getRuntime().freeMemory() + " bytes");: We print the current available memory to the console, using the Runtime.getRuntime().freeMemory() method to get the available memory in bytes.

4.	try { Thread.sleep(1000); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}: We use the Thread.sleep() method to pause the execution of the code for 1 second (1000 milliseconds), so that we don't overwhelm the system with too many requests. We also catch any InterruptedException that might occur.
