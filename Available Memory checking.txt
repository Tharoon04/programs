code:

import psutil

while True:
    print(f"Available memory: {psutil.virtual_memory().available} bytes")



Explanation:

import psutil: We import the psutil (process and system utilities) library, which provides an interface to access system details and process utilities.

while True: This is an infinite loop that will keep running until the program is manually stopped.

print(f"Available memory: {psutil.virtual_memory().available} bytes"): This line prints the current available memory in bytes. 
psutil.virtual_memory().available returns the available memory in bytes.
